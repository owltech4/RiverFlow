# Overview:
RiverFlow is a data pipeline solution designed to create a robust and efficient flow for data ingestion, storage, transformation, and visualization. Inspired by the fluidity and consistency of a river, RiverFlow connects different data sources, ensuring quality and accessibility at every stage of the process.

# Project Objective:
Automate the process of extracting and transforming data from an API, storing it in a scalable and reliable environment (Amazon Redshift), and making strategic information available for analysis through Looker Studio.

# Key Components:

Data Ingestion:

Integration with an API to programmatically and continuously extract data.

Ensures secure, timely, and resilient data collection.

Storage:

Extracted data will be stored in Amazon Redshift, leveraging its scalability and performance as a data warehouse solution.

Tables will be organized into well-defined schemas (Raw, Staging, Gold) for better data management.

Data Transformation:

Using dbt (Data Build Tool) to create models that clean, standardize, and organize data.

Layer creation:

Raw (Bronze): Untreated raw data.

Staging (Silver): Clean and standardized data.

Analytics (Gold): Data ready for analytical consumption.

Visualization:

Integration with Looker Studio to create interactive dashboards that provide real-time insights.

Ensures that the presented data is reliable and up to date.

Pipeline Flow:

Extraction:

The API is periodically accessed to collect data.

Monitoring logs ensure traceability at every step.

Loading:

Data is loaded into Amazon Redshift under the Raw schema.

Transformation:

dbt processes the data, applying business rules and standardization.

Transformed data is stored in the Analytics (Gold) tables for final consumption.

Visualization and Consumption:

Looker Studio directly consumes the Gold tables, enabling business teams to view KPIs, reports, and dashboards.

# Benefits of RiverFlow:

Automation: Reduces manual work and increases efficiency in data collection and processing.

Scalability: Leverages Amazon Redshiftâ€™s infrastructure to handle large data volumes.

Flexibility: dbt enables easy adjustments to transformations, aligning data with business needs.

Visibility: Interactive dashboards in Looker Studio support faster and more data-driven decision-making.

Reliability: Logs and monitoring ensure data is always accessible and accurate.

Next Steps:

Set up API integration and validate data ingestion.

Implement initial storage in Amazon Redshift.

Create the first dbt models and validate transformations.

Develop initial dashboards in Looker Studio.

RiverFlow is designed to be flexible and scalable, ensuring that the organization has access to the right information at the right time. With it, decision-making becomes based on reliable and future-proof data.
